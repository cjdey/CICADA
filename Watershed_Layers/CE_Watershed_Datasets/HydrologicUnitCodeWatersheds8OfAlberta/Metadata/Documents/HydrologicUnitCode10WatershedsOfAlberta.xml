			<abstract>This dataset is produced for the Government of Alberta and is available to the general public.  Please consult the Distribution Information of this metadata for the appropriate contact to acquire this dataset.  
The Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) Watersheds of Alberta represents a collection of five nested hierarchically structured drainage basin feature classes that have been created using the Hydrologic Unit Code system of classification developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) with accommodation to reflect the pre-existing Canadian classification system. The HUC Watersheds of Alberta consist of successively smaller hydrologic units that nest within larger hydrologic units, resulting in a hierarchal grouping of alphanumerically-coded watersheds feature classes.  There are currently individual feature classes for HUC 2 (coarsest level), HUC 4, HUC 6, HUC 8 and HUC 10 (finest level).  The HUC Watersheds of Alberta co-exists with the Watersheds of Alberta (GOA) as well as a number of other non-GOA watersheds datasets such as the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration watersheds data published by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The alphanumeric watershed coding follows the USGS system and also has a direct link to the Environment Canada Water Survey of Canada coding (as outlined by departmental Water Policy and Operations staff).  Where possible, Water Survey of Canada regions (00XX level) were approximated by the HUC 6 level of delineation but some exceptions will be noted.  Further delineation past the HUC 10 level may be required where smaller, more refined watershed units are needed. 

The coding is a ten-digit numeric code with the last two digits representing the unique identifier for the HUC 10 watershed.  The first eight digits represent the enclosing HUC 8 watershed.  The HUC 8 watersheds have been attributed with the Water Survey Canada region code and a basin name.  The basin names follow the names associated with the other HUC watersheds but not the names associated with the Watersheds of Alberta 2011.
NOTE: Watershed names may not be indicative of the entire geographic area for which they encompass. For instance, "Brazeau River Above Reservoir" is the watershed directly upstream of the Brazeau Reservoir, and does not include all watersheds upstream of the Brazeau Reservoir.</abstract>
			<purpose>Nested 10-digit HUC watersheds were originally created for Fisheries Management - Westslope Cutthroat Trout management purposes.  As per the previous established rule set, these watersheds were created solely based on hydrological principles so they are widely applicable to a variety of disciplines.

The HUC Watersheds of Alberta collection of feature classes is intended to define hydrologic units that form a standardized baseline which covers the province of Alberta. Successively smaller hydrologic units are nested within larger hydrologic units to create hierarchal watershed boundaries. These standard units are based on sound hydrologic principles (flow direction) and have been reconciled between and within the feature classes that form the dataset. Existing high resolution watersheds or catchment polygons have been collated into larger watershed units to achieve the hierarchical, nested polygon dataset structure.</purpose>
			<supplinf>Watershed boundaries will vary between existing watershed/basin GIS layers available from the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada. The user takes full responsibility understanding the spatial and temporal limitations of the HUC Watersheds of Alberta. Updates to this dataset will not necessarily be performed upon further review of existing watershed units. All rights reserved. HUC Watersheds of Alberta data is subject to change without notice. The Government of Alberta assumes no responsibility for discrepancies at time of use.</supplinf>

		<logic>The underlying data used to create the HUC Watersheds of Alberta are associated with various degrees of accuracy. There may be inconsistency in the spatial accuracy as a result. All HUC Watersheds of Alberta feature classes within the HUC Watersheds of Alberta feature dataset have been topologically reconciled between and within the feature classes for boundary alignment and gaps. The geometry has been checked and repaired.

The HUC Watersheds of Alberta feature class polygons may be represented as multipart polygons (i.e. there may be only one record in the database associated with more than one polygon). Multipart polygons are typically located in the same watershed or basin where by two (or more) polygons flow into another province or territory.</logic>

				<srccontr>ArcHydro Phase 2 is the current operational version. It is based on the provincial 100 metre DEM and the Simplified Linear Network (a simplified version of the Base Features Hydrography Arcs). All ArcHydro Phase 2 data are derived from these two datasets: 
1) The Provincial 100-metre Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
2) The Simplified Linear Network (SLN)

ArcHydro Phase 2 data was created as follows:
1) Burn the SLN into the DEM to create an Agree DEM. This creates stream channels in the DEM that match the SLN
2) The Agree DEM is fully filled (FIL)
3) A Flow Direction Grid (FDR) is created
4) A Flow Accumulation Grid (FAC) is created
5) Synthetic Drainage lines are created from the FAC
6) Catchments (CAT) are created for each Synthetic Stream Segment
7) The catchments and the Synthetic streams are vectorized
8) Adjoint Catchments are created for each catchment
9) A Geometric Network is made from the Synthetic Drainage
