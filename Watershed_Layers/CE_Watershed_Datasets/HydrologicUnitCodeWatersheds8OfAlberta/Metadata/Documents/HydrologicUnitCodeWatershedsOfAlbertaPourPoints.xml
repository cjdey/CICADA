The Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) Watersheds of Alberta represents a collection of four nested hierarchically structured drainage basin feature classes that have been created using the Hydrologic Unit Code system of classification developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) with accommodation to reflect the pre-existing Canadian classification system.  The pour points associated with the delineation of these watersheds have also been included as a point feature class.  The HUC Watersheds of Alberta consist of successively smaller hydrologic units that nest within larger hydrologic units, resulting in a hierarchal grouping of alphanumerically-coded watersheds feature classes.  These nesting watersheds feature classes were created using ArcHydro Tools v.2 (Alberta Environment and Parks) and are subject to periodic review and update. There are currently individual feature classes for HUC 2 (coarsest level), HUC 4, HUC 6 and HUC 8 (finest level). Due to the methodology used for the HUC 10 dataset the pour points have not beein included in this dataset as their use is limited. The HUC Watersheds of Alberta co-exists with the Watersheds of Alberta (GOA) as well as a number of other non-GOA watersheds datasets such as the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration watersheds data published by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The alphanumeric watershed coding follows the USGS system and also has a direct link to the Environment Canada Water Survey of Canada coding (as outlined by departmental Water Policy and Operations staff).  Where possible, Water Survey of Canada regions (00XX level) were approximated by the HUC 6 level of delineation but some exceptions will be noted.  Further delineation past the HUC 8 level may be required where smaller, more refined watershed units are needed. More information on the USGS hydrologic units can be found at http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html.  It should be noted that the HUC Watersheds of Alberta feature class polygons may be represented as multipart polygons (i.e. there may be only one record in the database associated with more than one polygon). Multipart polygons are typically located in the same watershed or basin where by two (or more) polygons flow into another province or territory. Multipart polygons may be exploded into single part polygons if required.

The Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta Pour Points exist as a feature class within the Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta feature dataset.  The HUC Watersheds of Alberta Pour Points feature class represents the location of the start or end of a specific watershed unit (stream confluence).  These pour points and the resulting watershed units were created 'on-the-fly' and only those watershed units that met the criteria were captured in the final delineation.  The data sources used to determine pour point location include the Alberta Base Features Single Line Network (SLNET) and its simplified version, available imagery and the Watersheds of Alberta 2011.   There are 841 pour points in total.  Currently, there are 19 HUC 2, 42 HUC 4, 132 HUC 6 and 422 HUC 8 watersheds that form the Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta so there is more than one pour point associated with a single watershed, even at the HUC 8 (finest) level of delineation.  Consistent delineation was applied to all basins and water courses in Alberta but ArcHydro Tools processing ultimately determined whether or not any particular pour point was snapped to a catchment polygon.  A maximum snap tolerance of six metres was applied.  The points were manually collated and may or may not represent a watershed in the HUC Watersheds of Alberta feature classes.

Note that this dataset replaces the Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta released on August 13, 2015.</abstract>
			<purpose>The Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta collection of feature classes is intended to define hydrologic units that form a standardized baseline which covers the province of Alberta. Successively smaller hydrologic units are nested within larger hydrologic units to create hierarchal watershed boundaries. These standard units are based on sound hydrologic principles (flow direction) and have been reconciled between and within the feature classes that form the dataset. Existing high resolution watersheds or catchment polygons have been collated into larger watershed units to achieve the hierarchical, nested polygon dataset structure.  The Hydrologic Code Watersheds of Alberta Pour Points is a derived aggregation of points collected by basin that was created during the watershed delineation process using the ArcHydro Tools v.2 (AEP) point delineation tool.  These points are to be used for reference purposes only and are intended to illustrate where a particular watershed potentially starts or ends. These points can be used to delineate watersheds if updates to the HUC Watersheds of Alberta layers are required.  </purpose>
			<supplinf>Watershed boundaries will vary between existing watershed/basin GIS layers available from the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada. The user takes full responsibility understanding the spatial and temporal limitations of the HUC Watersheds of Alberta. More information concerning data sources used can be found within the department using the keywords listed below. Updates to this dataset will not necessarily be performed upon further review of existing watershed units. All rights reserved. HUC Watersheds of Alberta data is subject to change without notice. The Government of Alberta assumes no responsibility for discrepancies at time of use. Watershed unit delineation follows ArcHydro Tools v2 process, as outlined by the ArcHydro Tools Community of Practice (COP). Scale and accuracy of the HUC Watersheds of Alberta mimic the scale and accuracy of data contained in ArcHydro Tools geodatabase. Metadata is available for those datasets.</supplinf>
