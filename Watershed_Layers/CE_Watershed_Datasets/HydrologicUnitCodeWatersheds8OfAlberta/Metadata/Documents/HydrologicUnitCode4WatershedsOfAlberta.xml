			<abstract>This dataset is produced for the Government of Alberta and is available to the general public.  Please consult the Distribution Information of this metadata for the appropriate contact to acquire this dataset.  

The Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) Watersheds of Alberta represents a collection of four nested hierarchically structured drainage basin feature classes that have been created using the Hydrologic Unit Code system of classification developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) with accommodation to reflect the pre-existing Canadian classification system.  The pour points associated with the delineation of these watersheds have also been included as a point feature class.  The HUC Watersheds of Alberta consist of successively smaller hydrologic units that nest within larger hydrologic units, resulting in a hierarchal grouping of alphanumerically-coded watersheds feature classes.  These nesting watersheds feature classes were created using ArcHydro Tools v.2 (Alberta Environment and Parks) and are subject to periodic review and update. There are currently individual feature classes for HUC 2 (coarsest level), HUC 4, HUC 6, HUC 8 and HUC 10 (finest level).  These are all contained within a single feature dataset.  The HUC Watersheds of Alberta co-exists with the Watersheds of Alberta (GOA) as well as a number of other non-GOA watersheds datasets such as the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration watersheds data published by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The alphanumeric watershed coding follows the USGS system and also has a direct link to the Environment Canada Water Survey of Canada coding (as outlined by departmental Water Policy and Operations staff).  Where possible, Water Survey of Canada regions (00XX level) were approximated by the HUC 6 level of delineation but some exceptions will be noted.  Further delineation past the HUC 10 level may be required where smaller, more refined watershed units are needed. More information on the USGS hydrologic units can be found at http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html.  It should be noted that the HUC Watersheds of Alberta feature class polygons may be represented as multipart polygons (i.e. there may be only one record in the database associated with more than one polygon). Multipart polygons are typically located in the same watershed or basin where by two (or more) polygons flow into another province or territory. Multipart polygons may be exploded into single part polygons if required.

The Hydrologic Unit Code 4 Watersheds of Alberta is a feature class within the Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta feature dataset that represents a seamless basin-wide coverage that falls completely within the Hydrologic Unit Code 2 Watersheds of Alberta.  The coding is a four-digit numeric code with the last two digits representing the unique identifier for the HUC 4 watershed.  The first two digits represent the enclosing HUC 2 watershed.  There are 42 polygons within this feature class ranging from 243 to 46 720 square kilometres in area with a mean area of 15 776 square kilometres.  Most of the HUC 4 watersheds are larger than 500 square kilometres.  There are 11 watersheds that are co-incident with the HUC 2 watersheds where the enclosing watersheds have not been subdivided.  The number of subdivisions of the enclosing HUC 2 watersheds ranges from one to seven but there are generally one to four subdivisions present.  Many of these subdivisions represent major tributaries but some are HUC 2 major river watersheds that have been split into upper, middle and lower portions along the mainstem of the river to create the HUC 4 watersheds.  The HUC 4 watersheds are further subdivided into 132 HUC 6 watersheds.

Note that this dataset replaces the Hydrologic Unit Code 4 Watersheds of Alberta released on August 13, 2015.</abstract>
			<purpose>The Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta collection of feature classes is intended to define hydrologic units that form a standardized baseline which covers the province of Alberta. Successively smaller hydrologic units are nested within larger hydrologic units to create hierarchal watershed boundaries. These standard units are based on sound hydrologic principles (flow direction) and have been reconciled between and within the feature classes that form the dataset. Existing high resolution watersheds or catchment polygons have been collated into larger watershed units to achieve the hierarchical, nested polygon dataset structure.</purpose>
			<supplinf>Watershed boundaries will vary between existing watershed/basin GIS layers available from the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada. The user takes full responsibility understanding the spatial and temporal limitations of the HUC Watersheds of Alberta. More information concerning data sources used can be found within the department using the keywords listed below. Updates to this dataset will not necessarily be performed upon further review of existing watershed units. All rights reserved. HUC Watersheds of Alberta data is subject to change without notice. The Government of Alberta assumes no responsibility for discrepancies at time of use. Watershed unit delineation follows ArcHydro Tools v2 process, as outlined by the ArcHydro Tools Community of Practice (COP). Scale and accuracy of the HUC Watersheds of Alberta mimic the scale and accuracy of data contained in ArcHydro Tools geodatabase. Metadata is available for those datasets.</supplinf>
